# TUT

Top Up Tracker helps you keep track of the recharges you make over time.

## MISSION

It has been observed that most people regardless of thier income spend more than supposed on airtime and that is why we decide to come up with this app to help keep track of your daily top-ups so as to have a full history of your recharge.

## UI

The UI of this app is structured in a very simple way that everyone can understand and navigate through. For account setting and issue handling TUT requires users to sign up with either their Email or Facebook account.

The dashboard displays the app name, logo and the menu which when pressed takes you to the transaction analysis, a summary gragh showing your monthly usage, card display for your weekly, monthly and yearly analysis. Each segment of analysis displays a table modal to fill up and then based on that display the break down analysis of usage.

## FUNCTIONALITY

The  App should be able

- to fetch and keep track of mobile network and number of the user
- to track the date of the recharge, the amount and the order number
- to tell if a recharge was successful or not and can allow for a repeat if transaction was unsuccessful.
- to render graphically the correct value as contained in the analysis.

## CURRENT STATE OF THE APP

The app should be able to track recharges made through the dailer and not VTUs.

## FUTURE

We will include the functionality of tracking recharges made by VTUs and other methods.
