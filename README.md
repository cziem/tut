# TUT

Top Up Tracker helps you keep track of the recharges you make over time.

# APP MISSION

It has been observed that most people regardless of thier income spend more than supposed on airtime and that is why we at LearnFactory Nigeria have decided to come up with this app to help keep track of your daily top-ups so as to have a full history of your recharge.

# UI

The UI of this app is structured in a very simple way that everyone can understand and navigate through. For account setting and issue handling TUT requires users to sign up with either their Email or Facebook account which then on a successful registration takes you to your dashboard of the App. The dashboard displays the app name, logo and the menu which when pressed takes you to the transaction analysis, a summary gragh showing your monthly usage, card display for your weekly, monthly and yearly analysis. Each segment of analysis displays a table modal to fill up and then based on that display the break down analysis of usage.

# FUNCTIONALITY

The  App should be able to fetch the name and mobile number of the person that made the top-up or the system used to make the top-up, the network provider to which the top-up was made, the date of the recharge, the amount, the order number and whether successfull or not. if successful the the repeat button will be made disable but active if not successful so that it will be repeated.

The app should be able to render graphically the correct value as contained in the analysis.

# CURRENT STATE OF THE APP

The app should be able to track recharges made through the dailer and not VTUs.

# FUTURE

We will include the functionality of tracking recharges made by VTUs and other methods.
